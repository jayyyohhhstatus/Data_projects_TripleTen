# NYC Airbnb Project 1 

## Overview
* A consulting company gave me a task to help a client analyze the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The client was interested in investing in several properties but wanted some guidance on what types of properties they should be targeting. My role in the project was to analyze data collected on current Airbnb listings to identify useful insights.

## Steps Taken
* Explored and Filtered the data
* Built a pivot table to determine the top 10 most popular neighborhoods for vacation rentals based on number of reviews 
* Build a pivot table to determine the number of bedrooms that are most popular for rentals.
* Created a new pivot table calculating the average of the occupancy to find the occupancy percentage. 
* Created a new pivot table to calculate the average price and occupancy rate for the neighborhood to generate annual revenue
