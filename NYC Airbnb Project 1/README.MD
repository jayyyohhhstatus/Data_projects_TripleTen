# NYC Airbnb Project 1 

## Overview
* A consulting company gave me a task to help a client analyze the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The client was interested in investing in several properties but wanted some guidance on what types of properties they should be targeting. My role in the project was to analyze data collected on current Airbnb listings to identify useful insights.
