## Overview
* The CEO of the last project assigned me to help them understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders.

## Steps Taken
* Created a scatterplot showing the correlation between total sales and total returns
* Created a bar chart showing the return rate by product category
*Created another visual of the return rate by customer. To find customers who are more prone to making returns, added a filter to remove customers with only 1 order.
*created a map showing the return rate by State

**All of the four visuals from above can be found on the dashboard below with user friendly filters avaliable if you click on the tableau project above**
* With the Visuals above i focused on California because it had the second highest return rate but was the largest in population and most profitable even with such a high return rate. So i made a line chart of the returns by month for the state of California
* August was the highest month for returns so i found the items and customers that made these returns and came up with a plan in my story to resolve these issues
