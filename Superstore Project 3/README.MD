## Overview
* A Superstore gave me a task as a consultant to review the operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.

## Steps Taken
* Created a bar graph to visualize the profit and losses by region for the sub categories 
* Needed to see if advertising was worth it by checking the average profit per unit sold so i found the best three states and months of the year by using Return On Ad Spending 
* Created a Visual for returned items by using the average profit against the average return rate
